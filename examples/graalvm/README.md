# Inspekt GraalVM Example

This is a simple example of using Inspekt in a Kotlin JVM project with GraalVM Native Image.

**My GraalVM build setup does not work for reasons I have yet to determine.**
But Inspekt should work with Graal just fine, there's just an issue with this example's build.

## Running

To run the native image:

```bash
./gradlew nativeRun
```
